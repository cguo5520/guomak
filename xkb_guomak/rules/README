This directory lists sets of rules which can be used to obtain an exact XKB
configuration.

## Charles Notes
evdev.lst seems to be mostly for UI selection of layouts

evdev and evdev.xml contain logic for how gnome loads symbols, compat, etc.

the distinction of responsibilities between evdev and evdev.xml is unclear

It looks like evdev is more important for `setxkbmap -print -verbose 10` and loading the display manager.
If evdev is not valid, the display manager doesn't load, but the layout still works in linux recovery mode.
